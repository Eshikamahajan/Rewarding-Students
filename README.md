DEADLINE NAME     DEADLINE                SELECTED STUDENTS
A                 15 - 30 April 5:00 pm           1
1                 15 - 26 April 5:00 pm           9
2                 15 - 28 April 5:00 pm           7
3                 15 - 30 April 5:00 pm           4

# NOTE
deadline A corresponds to a special reward thus it is taken out before all the other rewardees are selected. 
Clearly, deadline 2 include students who filled the form between 26 april after 5 pm and till 28 april 5 pm . But it also included the remaining students of category 1.
Same is the case with deadline 3 also.
